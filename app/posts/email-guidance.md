When a user receives an email from government, they need to:

- be able to recognise that the email is from an official government source
- trust the email is authentic (and not spam or phishing)
- understand why they’ve been contacted
- understand what they need to do next

## How to gain a user's trust

Start the email with the user’s name, if possible.

Write links out in full. Only send links which point to the GOV.UK domain.

Say who the message is from - consider that the name of your service might mean more to the user than your department or agency name.

## How to make emails useful

Include a reference number and contact details for your service if the user might need to contact you.

Be as brief and concise as possible - people tend to find managing their emails stressful. They also often do more than one thing at once when they’re reading emails.

Structure an email in the same way as web content. The most important information should be at the top.

### The ‘from’ field

The ‘from’ field should show a name that’s recognisable, such as the service name. If you can, test with users to see if they recognise and trust the name in the ‘from’ field.

Aim for no more than 25 characters (many inbox views truncate ’from’ fields after this many characters).

### The subject line

Try to make subject lines specific. Research suggests users think vague subject lines (such as ‘important information’) could be spam.

Try to front-load the subject line and limit to 40 characters.

Don’t repeat sender information in the subject line.

Don’t use the recipients’ names in the subject line.

## Information for developers
