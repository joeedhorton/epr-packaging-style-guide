title: "Style guide - extended producer responsibility (EPR) for packaging"
description: "A guide covering style, spelling and grammar conventions for EPR for packaging content. Managed by the EPR digital team."
---

The aim of this guide is to make sure we’re consistent in the way we communicate with users affected by extended producer responsibility (EPR) for packaging.

Users include:

- organisations that handle and supply packaging
- compliance schemes
- local authorities

This guide has been designed to complement the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide), rather than to supersede it.

# Who is this guide for?

Anyone who communicates with the user groups affected by EPR for packaging, using channels such as:

- GOV.UK
- newsletters or emails
- webinars

# What is this guide based on?

This guide is based on:

- best practice for [writing for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk)
- user research done by the digital team

The digital team has tested different parts of the EPR for packaging service with users. This has given us a good insight into words and phrases that work well for most users. 

Sometimes we use language that is different from the language in the formal legislation. This is because we need to make sure we use words that the majority of our users will understand. This is common practice on GOV.UK. 

By making things as simple as possible, we make sure our users will be able to achieve their tasks easily. This could increase compliance rates and reduce queries and complaints. 

We work with subject matter experts to make sure that any content we publish is factually accurate.

# A to Z

## Acronyms and abbreviations

Follow the [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) for more general advice on acronyms and abbreviations.

See ‘extended producer responsibility’ for more information about how to use the EPR acronym.

## Defra

Some users aren’t aware of Defra’s role, so avoid referring to Defra unless necessary. Instead of ‘submit your data to Defra’ say ‘submit your data’.

## Deposit Return Scheme (DRS)

Upper case. 

Write out in full the first time it’s used on a page, before using the ‘DRS’ acronym. 

## Data

When we talk about the data users need to report, we explain it in the following way:


> There should be 4 parts to the data you collect about your packaging. These are:
> - packaging activity – this is how you put the packaging on the market
> - packaging material and weight
> - packaging type – primary, secondary, shipment or transit
> - waste type



Don’t use the phrase ‘placed on the market’ - this is for internal use only. Instead say ‘packaging data’. 

Other types of data include ‘nation data’ and ‘registration data’.

## Direct producer

Don’t use ‘direct producer’ in any user-facing content. See ‘producer’ for more information.

## Drinks containers

Not ‘drink containers’. 

## Environment Agency

Upper case.

Don’t use the acronym, always write out in full. 

## Extended producer responsibility

Lower case.

More experienced users seem to understand and use the acronym ‘EPR’. In testing, some users found the acronym easier to read. 

‘EPR’ is also used on different industry websites, so may be a common search term.

Always explain the acronym the first time it’s used on a page. For example: ‘extended producer responsibility (EPR)’.

For a transaction that’s made up of more than one page, write out ‘extended producer responsibility’ in full on the first page, then use ‘EPR’ on all other pages. 

The EPR acronym is also used for Environmental Permitting Regulations. To avoid confusion, don’t use ‘EPR’ on its own. Instead say ‘EPR for packaging’.

## Handle or supply

We use this phrase to refer generally to the sorts of organisations that are affected by EPR for packaging. 

For example:

> The regulations will apply to all UK organisations that handle and supply packaging to consumers and businesses. 

Don’t say ‘organisations that work with packaging’ - this phrase did not perform well in testing. 

## Household waste

Lower case. 

## Large organisation

Don’t say ‘large producer’. This is a phrase that we should only use internally.

For user-facing content, we refer to large producers as being a ‘large organisation’.

## Nation data

Lower case.

Nation data is what we say when referring to the nation of sale obligation. For consistency, it’s important we use this phrase only and don’t use alternatives such as ‘nation of sale’ or ‘nation of reporting’ in user-facing content.

## Natural Resources Wales

Upper case.

Don’t use the acronym, always write out in full. 

## Non-household waste

Lower case and hyphenated. 

## Northern Ireland Environment Agency

Upper case.

Don’t use the acronym, always write out in full. 

## Obligated

We try to avoid using the word ‘obligated’ where possible, as it isn’t Plain English. However, sometimes it’s unavoidable.

Instead of referring to ‘obligated packaging’ you could call it ‘packaging that you’re responsible for'.

Instead of saying ‘legally obligated' you could use phrases such as:

> affected by EPR for packaging

or

> take action under EPR for packaging

## Online marketplace

Lower case. ‘Marketplace’ is all one word. 

## Packaging activities (producer types)

The packaging activities are how we refer to the way producers handle and supply packaging. 

It’s important that we don’t use the policy labels for the different actors ('brand owner', ‘distributor’ etc.) in user-facing content. This increases a user’s cognitive load, as they need to work out which actor category they fit into.

### The packaging activities for working out if you’re obligated

When users are working out if they are obligated or not, we ask them if they carry out any of the packaging activities. 

We say:

> You may need to act if you do any of the following:
> - supply packaged goods to the UK market under your own brand
> - package goods for another UK organisation
> - use ‘transit packaging’ to protect goods during transport so they can be sold to UK consumers
> - import products in packaging
> - own an online marketplace
> - hire or loan out reusable packaging
> - sell empty packaging

### The packaging activities for collecting data

When users are working out how to categorise their data, we refer to the packaging activities in a slightly different way. This is because users need to categorise their data in terms of how they placed packaging on the market. Because of this, we phrase the activities in the past tense. 

We say:

> You need to tell us what your role was when you put the packaging on the market. You do this by breaking down your data into the different packaging activities. These are: 
> - sold under your brand 
> - packed or filled as unbranded 
> - imported 
> - sold as empty packaging 
> - hired or loaned 
> - sold through an online marketplace that you own

## Parent company

Use ‘parent company’ instead of ‘holding company’ or ‘holding group’. 

Parent companies are made up of subsidiary companies. 

## Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic

Always write out in full and provide the acronym and some users know this type of plastic by its acronym. 

## PRNs and PERNs

Write out in full, in lower case, when used for the first time on a page.

For example:

> packaging waste recycling notes (PRNs)
and 
> packaging export recycling notes (PERNs)

## Producer

Avoid using the word ‘producer’ in user-facing content as a way of referring to organisations that are legally obligated. 

Although some users understand what is meant by the word producer, others find it confusing. There is evidence that more inexperienced users assume that a producer is an organisation that manufactures packaging. 

The word producer is used internally as an umbrella term that refers to a range of different users who are legally obligated by the EPR regulations.

For small producer - see ‘small organisation’.

For large producer - see ‘large organisation’.

Avoid saying ‘direct producer’.

## Regulations

Avoid saying ‘EPR regulations’ as the regulations technically fall under producer responsibility, rather than extended producer responsibility. 

Instead you could say:

> Find out more about the EPR for packaging requirements

or

> Find out if you’ll be impacted by EPR for packaging

It’s fine to use the word ‘regulations’ on its own.

For example:

> Find out if the regulations affect you

## Report packaging data

The name of the service that producers will use to comply with EPR for packaging. 

The service is made up of tasks including:

- check if you need to report packaging data
- register for this year
- collect your packaging data
- submit your packaging data
- pay your fees

## Self-managed waste

Hyphenated. 

## Scottish Environment Protection Agency

Upper case.

Don’t use the acronym, always write out in full. 

## Single-use

Hyphenated. As in ‘single-use drinks containers’. 

## Small organisation

Don’t say ‘small producer’. This is a phrase that we should only use internally.

For user-facing content, we refer to small producers as being a ‘small organisation’.

## Street bin waste

Lower case, no hyphen. 

Use ‘street bin waste’, not ‘commonly littered’ or ‘commonly binned’. 

## Transit/ tertiary packaging

Use ‘transit packaging’, not ‘tertiary packaging’. 

In some instances it can be useful to remind users that transit packaging is also known as tertiary packaging. 

## Waste management fee

Lower case.

‘Waste management fee’ is what we say when referring to the waste cost obligation.

## Weight

Refer to weight, rather than ‘tonnage’. If necessary, clarify that weight should be provided to the nearest tonne or kilogram. 

Use ‘tonne’ and ‘kg’.
